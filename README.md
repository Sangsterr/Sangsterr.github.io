        <h2>About me:</h2>

        <p>I currently live in Stockport, which is where I was born.</p>   
        <p> I am currently a personal trainer, looking to become a full time developer!<br>I have plenty of hobbies, such as:</p>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Hiking</li>
            <li>Exercising</li>
            <li>Studying code in my spare time</li>
            <li>Meeting up with friends for an endless list of activities</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Maybe I should list some here, in an ordered list?! Why not...</p>
        <ol>
            <li>I LOVE my food, so I am always meeting my friends for food & drinks</li>
            <li>I often go rock-climbing with my friends</li>
            <li>Me and my partner are into exercise challenges, so we're usually training for these when we get the chance!</li>
            <li>I also love to visit my partners family too!</li>
        </ol>
